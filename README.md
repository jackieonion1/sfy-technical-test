# sfy-technical-test

Hi, this is my project for the SFY techincal test.
I know there is a lot to be fixed like:
- Handle failed API calls.
- Fix weird behaviour of the *Pull to load more* feature.
- Images loading is not really eficient.
- And much more.

But I think it's ok to show my actual programming skills.

I decided not to add external libraries (for example I thought using *KingFisher* to load the images) to keep the project cleaner and simplier.
